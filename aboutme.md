subtitle: An Eccentric, but Loveable, Maverick.

My name is Rob Bennett. While it's hard to summarize a person with a few bullet-points, I'll try:

- I am a former culinarian, with near 30 years in the field!
- I'm a trained sommelier, and fine wine and distilled spirits to be interesting. 
- I deeply enjoy role-playing games, including but not limited to D&D, White-Wolf, and Shadowrun
- The Theory of Mind, evolutionary biology, and philosophy are pet topics of mine and I'm always willing to chat about them.
- The intersection between Machine Learning and biological learning is deeply fascinating to me.


### My History

I started my professional career at the ripe old age of 9, working for my dad in his kitchens. His thirteenth birthday present to me was a job as a dishwasher. I was thrilled. Truly.
Over the years, I've added many subjects of study to my conversational knowledge, but I have a special love for philosophy. I *adore* Nihilistic, Existential or Absurdist thought. I spend a lot of time thinking about the meaning of my existence, or human existence, or do we exist. You get the idea.
In the summer of 2017, I read a book called Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and it shifted my world view. It sparked an interest in evolutionary biology, the human mind, and the social animals that we are. I live in Seattle, and have many friends in the tech world. One conversation led to another, and the link between evolution, the 'mind', and machine learning was eventually bridged. After a few years of supporting my life partner finish her Pharmacy school, I was able to pursue my own education in data science. And here we are.
In October of 2019, I had my first (and probably last) child, Arius. He is an absolute delight and watching him develop has only strengthened my desire to learn *how* we learn, and more importantly, how we can *teach* something else to learn.
Thank you for taking the time to read about me.
